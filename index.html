        are now a symbol for Sicily, but they have a very ancient and important
        history behind them. A legend made of passion and jealousy between two
        lovers.
        <br />
        Any Sicilian, walking through the streets of their city or country, will
        have come across at least once in their life in
        <span class="moor">the Moor's Heads</span> , that is, those hand-painted
        ornamental ceramic vases that depict the face of a man and a woman.
        <br />
        These vases, emblem of Sicilian culture and art, are not born from a
        surprising creative flair on the part of Sicilian artisans, but are the
        result of a legend that has spread over the centuries. Behind
        <span class="moor">the Moor's Heads</span>, also known in Sicilian as
        <em>Graste</em>, hides a love story made of passion, betrayal, jealousy
        and resulted in revenge. <br />

      <h5><span class="moor">The Moor's heads</span>: history</h5>
      <p>
        It is said that around the year 1000, during the domination of the Moors
        in Sicily, in the Arab quarter <em>Kalsa</em> (in the heart of Palermo)
        lived a beautiful girl who spent her days dedicating herself to taking
        care of her plants. One day, from the top of her luxuriant balcony, she
        was noticed by a Moor who was passing by that part of her. <br />
        This, as soon as he saw her, immediately fell in love with her and did
        not hesitate for a moment to declare his love for her. The girl, struck
        by this declaration, returned the Moor's sentiment with passion, but
        their story, which began with such ardor, was destined for a short life.
        Soon the young woman discovered that her loved one had to return to the
        East where his wife and children were waiting for him. <br />
        In the middle of the night, feeling betrayed and humiliated, the girl
        abandoned herself to a moment of jealousy and fatal anger by killing her
        Moro while she was sleeping. Later she cut off the head and created a
        sort of vase in which she planted a basil sprout inside which she took
        care of day by day. Thanks to its intoxicating scent, the basil plant,
        considered the herb of kings (from the Greek <em>Basilikos</em>), caught
        the envy of the girl's neighbors who wasted no time in making terracotta
        pots with the same features as
        <span class="moor">the Moor's Head.</span> <br />

      <h5>The legend of <span class="moor">the Moor's Heads</span> today</h5>
      <p>
        Today <span class="moor">the Moro heads</span> are almost always
        reproduced in pairs. Both vases, which hold a crown and a turban on
        their heads that recall the East, are richly adorned with jewels,
        flowers and citrus fruits. Their charm also struck the <a href="http://www.myurbanbonton.com/dolce-gabbana-racconta-la-cultura-siciliana-le-teste-di-moro-di-caltagirone-ela-loro-storia/">Dolce & Gabbana</a> 
        designers who in 2014 made them the protagonists of a surprising
        collection.
